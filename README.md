# Flutter Create
A simple application for [Flutter Create Participation](https://flutter.dev/create)

## Description
<img src="/assets/1.png" width="40%"> &nbsp; <img src="/assets/1.gif" width="40%">
This is the most useless application in the world. When launched, the application loads data from my database and displays it as if it were code in a text editor.
Next, the user must reduce the amount of code by clicking on the words.

When the user deletes all unnecessary words, a new useless screen will open, on which the user can write a post on Twitter.

_In this app I used a database, animations, some material widgets, a custom font._
